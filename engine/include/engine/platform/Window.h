// ============================================================================
//  Window.h - the actual operating-system window the game appears in.
//
//  One of these exists for the whole program. It owns two things that SDL
//  gives us: the window itself, and the "renderer" attached to it (SDL's name
//  for the object that draws into a window).
//
//  NOTICE WHAT IS NOT IN THIS HEADER: the word SDL. Nothing outside the
//  platform layer needs to know which library opens the window, and keeping
//  that name out of the public headers is what would make swapping SDL for
//  something else an edit to a handful of .cpp files rather than to the whole
//  engine.
//
//  WHY COPYING A WINDOW IS FORBIDDEN
//  A Window owns a resource that belongs to the operating system. If you could
//  copy one, both copies would refer to the SAME OS window, and both would try
//  to close it when they were destroyed - closing something twice. There is no
//  sensible meaning for "a second copy of this window", so the class refuses
//  to compile the attempt (see the `= delete` lines below).
