// ============================================================================
//  ResourceManager.cpp - loading images. See ResourceManager.h.
//
//  The whole file is about one table:
//
//      std::unordered_map<std::string, std::weak_ptr<Texture>> g_cache;
//
//  std::unordered_map is the standard hash table: given a key (here, the
//  file's path) it finds the matching value quickly no matter how many entries
//  there are. It is the right container for "look this up by name".
//
//  The value is a std::WEAK_ptr rather than a shared_ptr, and that choice is
//  the interesting part. A shared_ptr counts as an owner, so a cache full of
//  them would keep every texture ever loaded alive until the program exited -
//  a cache that is also a leak. A weak_ptr watches a shared_ptr without owning
//  it: it can tell you whether the thing is still alive and hand you a real
//  reference if it is, but it does not by itself keep it alive.
//
//  So: the sprites own the textures, and the cache only remembers where they
//  are.
